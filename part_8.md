One conventional way to handle this is to use the get method of the request.form dictionary, which allows you to specify a default value if the key isn't found. This method is beneficial because it distinguishes between a missing key and a key with an empty string value.

Here's how you can adjust your input field:

html
Copy code
<input name="list_name" type="text" value="{{ request.form.get('list_name', list['name']) }}">
In this revised line:

request.form.get('list_name', list['name']) will return the value associated with list_name if it exists in request.form, even if it's an empty string.
If list_name isn't in request.form (which would be the case when the form is displayed for the first time), it defaults to list['name'].

Use request object to access `id` <li><a href="/lists/{{request.view_args.id}}/edit">Edit List</a></li>

Add class="edit" to the anchor tag
